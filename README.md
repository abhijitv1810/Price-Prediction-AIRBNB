README: Airbnb Pricing Strategy Project Notebooks

Overview

This repository contains a series of Python notebooks developed as part of the "Airbnb Pricing Strategy" project. The project focuses on applying data science techniques to the Airbnb market in Boston, aiming to optimize pricing strategies for hosts and enhance accommodation selection for travelers.

Notebooks Description

The repository includes the following notebooks:

Price_Prediction.ipynb

Purpose: This notebook is the starting point of the analysis. It focuses on predicting Airbnb listing prices in Boston using various machine learning models.
Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Model Development: Implementing and evaluating multiple regression models, including the Random Forest Regressor.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing models based on metrics like R-squared and RMSE.

Clustering_Latitude_Longitude.ipynb

Purpose: This notebook follows the price prediction analysis. It clusters Airbnb listings based on their geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Key Components:
Data Preparation: Extracting and processing geographical data from the listings.
K-Means Clustering: Applying K-Means to segment listings into clusters based on location.
Cluster Analysis: Interpreting the results to understand geographical market segments.

Clustering_Text.ipynb

Purpose: This notebook complements the previous analyses by focusing on text-based clustering.
Key Components:
Text Data Extraction: Gathering and preprocessing text data from listing descriptions and reviews.
Text Clustering: Implementing clustering algorithms on textual features.
Analysis and Insights: Drawing conclusions from text-based clusters to inform listing optimization strategies.

Execution Order

For a comprehensive understanding and best results, the notebooks should be executed in the following order:

Price_Prediction.ipynb
Clustering_Latitude_Longitude.ipynb
Clustering_Text.ipynb

Additional Information

Each notebook contains detailed instructions and commentary explaining the steps followed.
The notebooks are designed to be self-contained but are interconnected in terms of the overall project workflow.
